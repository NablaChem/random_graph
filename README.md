# Random Graphs

This is a standalone project to test the proportion of H-simple bipartite graphs.
We implement a very high level class for bipartite graphs, but advise against using this code more generally:
it is heavily optimised specifically for the task of running a switch chain in the space of bipartite graphs,
and is likely unsuitable for other purposes.
